		<h2>Mosstest will officially be released on January 1, 2014, at 12:00 GMT. This is 8:00 PM in New York. You can browse and run the code at the moment although services like the server tracker will only open at that time. In fact, we encourage server owners to get ready relatively early, as the server tracker will be open to adding servers at that time.</h2>

Mosstest is a project aiming to make an open-source, Java-based clone of a commonly-played game--Minecraft. We've taken a look at Minecraft, and saw problems--Commercial background, and performance issues on older machines. Honestly, not everyone needs shaders and extreme render distances. Plugins were annoying to install, or mods for clients even more so, requiring client-side action, and straight OpenGL implementation has drastic performance problems that it’s used to correct..
</p><p>
We also took a look at another project, Minetest. Minetest was a start to solving problems, but it had its problems as well. While it had been made to address performance issues, graphics rendering became extremely CPU heavy and server lag increased due to the poorly-implemented network protocol, especially sending large data such as chunks, and due to the fact that all plugins ran on servers. Clients only had rudimentary node placement prediction, and would encounter severe lag, often becoming unplayable.
</p><p>
Minecraft and Minetest alike suffer from OpenGL issues, but with Mosstest, jMonkeyEngine 3, our graphics library, is implemented to address said bugs. Unlike Minetest and the original Minecraft, server plugins for Mosstest are written in JavaScript and run both on the server and the client. To accommodate for the insecurity of running scripts on the client, we’re developing a system for sandboxing scripts and allow them access to only certain Mosstest-related classes and sandboxed game database access. Networking has been improved with a TCP/UDP hybrid. Important (as in reliability) and large packets travel over TCP, and smaller, realtime packets travel over UDP.
<p>
In addition, after developing the most important components for gameplay, we plan to continue into performance enhancement--peer-to-peer enhanced gameplay lessening the server’s role in interactions between players, and leaving the server to only operate on more important gameplay functions. Our second extended goal is to create a load-balancer framework where server events are delegated between multiple machines on a LAN or even WAN.
